Application viewing models using Vulkan graphics API.

To build it you will need:
Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows
GLFW library: https://www.glfw.org/download.html
GLM: https://github.com/g-truc/glm
STB: https://github.com/nothings/stb
Tinyobjloader: https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader

Plus add it in appropriate places as include directories in solution.

I plan to make it work "out of the box" in the future.
